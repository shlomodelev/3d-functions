# 3d-functions
A C# program that displays graphs of  3D (Z = f(X,Y)) functions entered by the user.
-------------------
How to use the program:

1. Enter the desired fucntion to the "f(x,y)" textbox as a mathematical expression with x and y as variables. 
2. Click the "Draw Function" button
3. You can change the viewing propeties using the other buttons. By clicking each button the graph will automatically redraw itself with its new properties. Here is a list of what each button or group of buttons do:

- [X/Y/Z][++/--] |  Increase/decrease the value of all the points on the graph on the appropriate axis. Visually translates to moving the graph along the axis.

- Change Y and Z Axes | Switch between the Y and Z axes in the representation (i.e. turn the point [x,y,z] to [x,z,y] and vice versa). 

- Net On/Off | Show or hide the net of lines that connet between consecutive points on the graph.

- Fill On/Off | Show or hide the colored filling of the graph.

- Rotate [(x,y)/(x,z)] | Rotate the graph 10 degrees clockwise in the appropriate plane.

- Shrink/Enlarge | Divide/multiply all the values of the graph by 2.

- Reset All Settings | Go back to the default settings.


4. You can also monitor the size of the viewing scale and the angle of view using the two appropriate textboxes. Pressing the enter key on your keyboard while your cursor is on the textbox will redraw the graph with the new properties.
